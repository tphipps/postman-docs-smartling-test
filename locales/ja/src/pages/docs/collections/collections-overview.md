*Postman Collections* are a group of saved requests. Every request you send in Postman appears under the **History** tab of the sidebar. On a small scale, reusing requests through the history section is convenient. As your Postman usage grows, it can be time\-consuming to find a particular request in your history. Instead of scrolling through your history section, you can save all your requests as a group for easier access.

Creating your first collection
------------------------------

If you're getting started with collections for the first time, learn how to [Create your first collection](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/).

Using collections
-----------------

After you've created collections, you can learn more about how to manage and use them in [Using collections](/docs/collections/using-collections/).

Running collections
-------------------

The *Collection Runner* enables you to run a collection's requests in a specified sequence. You can run collections manually, on a schedule, from a monitor, from a webhook, or in your CI/CD pipeline by running it from the command line.

To learn more about running collections, see [Using the Collection Runner](/docs/collections/running-collections/running-collections-overview/).

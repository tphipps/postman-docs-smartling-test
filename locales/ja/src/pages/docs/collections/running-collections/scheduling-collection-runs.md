Many Postman users run collections at specific times each day or week. For example, you may want to run a collection that tests your API every day. You can use the Collection Runner to schedule collection runs to execute automatically at specified days and times.
> 
> You can also schedule collection runs using [monitors](/docs/collections/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs-monitors/). Monitors are typically used to schedule runs when you want to set up alerts like triggering on\-call upon failure. Choose the Collection Runner to schedule runs for all other use cases.

When you schedule a collection run with the Collection Runner, the scheduled run is added to the collection's **Runs** tab. You can view, pause, edit, and delete scheduled collection runs from the collection's **Runs** tab.

> 
> * Scheduled runs execute in the Postman Cloud.
> * Schedules share permissions with their collections. For example, if you have permissions to edit a collection, you'll be able to edit that collection's schedules.
> * Personal, private, and team workspaces support scheduling collection runs.
> * If you import or export a collection, its schedules don't import or export with it. However, if you delete a collection, its schedules are deleted also.
> * Scheduled collection runs have the same [usage limits as monitors](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).

Scheduling a collection run
---------------------------

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection you want to schedule.

2. Select ![Runner icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon) **Run** .
   > 
   > You can also select ![Runner icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon) **Runner** from the Postman footer and drag a collection from **Collections** or **History** in the sidebar.
3. On the Collection Runner, select **Schedule runs** .

   ![Schedule runs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/schedule-runs-3-v10.jpg)
4. Choose any configuration options:

   * The schedule's name
   * The run's frequency
   * An environment associated with the collection \(optional\)
   * How many times you want the collection to run \(iterations\)
   * A `JSON` or `CSV` [data file](/docs/collections/running-collections/working-with-data-files/) \(optional\)
   * Notification recipients \(optional\)
   * Advanced settings \(optional\) 
     * Retry if run fails
     * Set request timeout
     * Set delay between requests
     * Follow redirects
     * Enable SSL validation

5. By default, your requests run in the sequence they're listed in the collection. If you need to change the order of execution, select and drag a request to its new location in the order. You can also remove an individual request from the run by clearing the checkbox next to its name. For more information, see [Changing run order](#changing-run-order).

6. Select the **Schedule Run** button.
> 
> API calls made by scheduled collection runs are deducted from your maximum number of monitoring API calls. For more information about checking your monitor usage, see [Managing monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).

Viewing a scheduled run

Changing run order
------------------

Many Postman users use collections as repositories of requests, which they run in different sequences to represent different workflows or different variations of the same workflow. The Collection Runner already enables you to change the order of your requests and skip requests before running them. Similarly, when scheduling your collection runs, you can re\-order your requests and save this custom order to be run on a schedule. This enables you to use the same collection to automate multiple test scenarios.

To change the request order in a scheduled run, do the following:

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection you want to schedule.

2. Select ![Runner icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon) **Run** .
   > 
   > You can also select ![Runner icon](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-runner-v9.jpg#icon) **Runner** from the Postman footer and drag a collection from **Collections** or **History** in the sidebar.
3. On the Collection Runner, select **Schedule runs** .

   ![Schedule runs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/schedule-runs-3-v10.jpg)
4. Under **RUN ORDER** , change the order by dragging and dropping requests. Skip a request by clearing its checkbox.

   ![Custom run order v10](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/scr-custom-order-v10.gif)
5. Select the **Schedule Run** button.

When a new request is added or deleted from a scheduled run's collection, the scheduled run has a **Review Changes** link next to it under **Runs > Scheduled runs** . Select the link to review and edit the changes. In the example below, a new request was added:

![Schedule runs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/v10/scr-review-custom-order-v10.gif)
> 
> Requests run as part of a scheduled run are rate limited and usage is deducted from your maximum monitor usage. For more information about checking your monitor usage, see [Managing monitor usage](/docs/monitoring-your-api/monitor-usage/).

Deleting a scheduled run
------------------------

1. Select **Collections** in the sidebar and select the collection with the scheduled run you want to delete.

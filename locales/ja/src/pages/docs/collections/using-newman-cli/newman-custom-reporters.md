*Custom reporters* are useful to generate collection run reports with Newman that cater to specific use cases, for example, logging out the response body when a request \(or its tests\) fail.

Building custom reporters
-------------------------

A custom reporter is a Node.js module with a name of the form `newman-reporter-<name>`.

To create a custom reporter, do the following:

1. In the directory of your choice, create a blank npm package with `npm init`.

2. Add an `index.js` file, which exports a function of the following form:

   ```javascript
   function (emitter, reporterOptions, collectionRunOptions) {
     // emitter is is an event emitter that triggers the following events: https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunevents
     // reporterOptions is an object of the reporter specific options. The usage examples below have more details.
     // collectionRunOptions is an object of all the collection run options:
     // https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman#newmanrunoptions-object--callback-function--run-eventemitter
   };
   ```

3. Publish your reporter using `npm publish`, or use your reporter locally. Read the usage instructions for more information.

Scoped reporter package names like `@myorg/newman-reporter-<name>` are also supported.

Using custom reporters
----------------------

To use the custom reporter, it will have to be installed first. For instance, to use the Newman TeamCity reporter, install the reporter package:

```bash
npm install newman-reporter-teamcity
```

Note that the name of the package is of the form `newman-reporter-<name>`, where `<name>` is the actual name of the reporter. The installation is global if Newman is installed globally, local otherwise. Run `npm install ...` with the `-g` flag for a global installation.

To use local \(non\-published\) reporters, run the command `npm install <path/to/local-reporter-directory>` instead.

Use the installed reporter, either with the command\-line tool, or programmatically. Here, the `newman-reporter` prefix isn't required while specifying the reporter name in the options.

Scoped reporter packages must be specified with the scope prefix. For instance, if your package name is `@myorg/newman-reporter-name`, you must specify the reporter with `@myorg/name`.

On the command line:

```bash
newman run /path/to/collection.json -r myreporter --reporter-myreporter-<option-name> <option-value> # The option is optional
```

Programmatically:

```js
var newman = require('newman');

newman.run({
   collection: '/path/to/collection.json',
   reporters: 'myreporter',
   reporter: {
     myreporter: {
       'option-name': 'option-value' // this is optional
     }
   }
}, function (err, summary) {
  if (err) { throw err; }
  console.info('collection run complete!');
});
```

In both cases above, the reporter options are optional.

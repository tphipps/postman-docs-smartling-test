File uploads
------------

Newman supports file uploads. For this to work, upload the file in the relative location specified in the collection. For instance, review this collection:

```json
{
    "variables": [],
    "info": {
        "name": "file-upload",
        "_postman_id": "9dbfcf22-fdf4-f328-e440-95dbd8e4cfbb",
        "description": "A set of `POST` requests to upload files as form data fields",
        "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.0.0/collection.json"
    },
    "item": [
        {
            "name": "Form data upload",
            "event": [
                {
                    "listen": "test",
                    "script": {
                        "type": "text/javascript",
                        "exec": [
                            "var response = JSON.parse(responseBody).files[\"sample-file.txt\"];",
                            "",
                            "tests[\"Status code is 200\"] = responseCode.code === 200;",
                            "tests[\"File was uploaded correctly\"] = /^data:application\\/octet-stream;base64/.test(response);",
                            ""
                        ]
                    }
                }
            ],
            "request": {
                "url": "https://postman-echo.com/post",
                "method": "POST",
                "header": [],
                "body": {
                    "mode": "formdata",
                    "formdata": [
                        {
                            "key": "file",
                            "type": "file",
                            "enabled": true,
                            "src": "sample-file.txt"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "description": "Uploads a file as a form data field to `https://postman-echo.com/post` using a `POST` request."
            },
            "response": []
        }
    ]
}
```

The file `sample-file.txt` must be present in the current working directory as the collection. Run this collection as usual.

```bash
$ newman run file-upload.postman_collection.json
```
